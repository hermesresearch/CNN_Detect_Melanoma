## General Information
This project aims to develop a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for accurate detection of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. The objective is to automate the evaluation of skin images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma, thereby reducing the manual effort required for diagnosis. The dataset used for this project contains images of various skin diseases, including melanoma.

## Technologies Used
TensorFlow version: 2.12.0
Keras version: 2.12.0
NumPy version: 1.22.4

## Conclusion
After training the CNN model on the provided dataset, we achieved promising results in accurately detecting different types of skin diseases, including melanoma. The model demonstrated high accuracy and can potentially assist dermatologists in diagnosing skin cancer at an early stage. However, further evaluation and validation are necessary before deploying the model in real-world scenarios.
